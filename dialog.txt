#suit
Wizard: Well, look at you! What a shiny suit of armor you've got there!
Player: This isn't armor; it's just a suit! I had an important meeting!
Wizard: A suit? How delightful! It looks quite formidable. Ready to battle a dragon at a grand gathering?
Player: More like trying to impress some folks at a gathering, but I see your point!

#casual clothes
Wizard: By the stars! What in the realm are you wearing? It looks... comfortable?
Player: This? It's just a casual outfit! Perfect for hanging out or running errands.
Wizard: Casual outfit? How delightful! I’ve never seen such garments. Are they woven from the finest dragon scales?
Player: Nope! Just cotton. No dragons involved, I promise.
Wizard: A gathering, you say? A cunning foe indeed! But tell me, does it offer any protection against fireballs? I hope so because you'll need it

#bathing suit
Wizard: By the stars! Is that what passes for clothing where you come from?
Player: This? It's a bathing suit! Perfect for a beach day!
Wizard: A bathing suit? Fascinating! So, in your world, you don’t like wearing clothes?
Player: Well, we do, just not when we’re swimming or lounging. It's comfortable!
Wizard: Comfortable, you say? Here, you'd catch the eye of every ogre in the forest!
Player: Ogres? Yikes! I didn't think about that!
Wizard: Yes, they'd probably think you’re a snack. A very unusual snack.
Player: So, what's the dress code here?
Wizard: Layers, my friend! A good robe, sturdy boots, and perhaps a hat to ward off prying eyes!
Player: I guess I'll need a whole new wardrobe, then.

#robe
Wizard: Well, well! Look at you in that splendid robe! Are you a wizard from some far-off land?
Player: Uh, this? It's just a bathrobe. I was having a lazy day!
Wizard: A bathrobe? Fascinating! I’ve never seen such a stylish wizarding garment. Where do you hail from?
Player: I'm from a place where we wear these for comfort, not magic. No spells here, just snacks!
Wizard: *under breath* They are never going to make it out of here.

Wizard: Excuse me, but have you eaten an orc recently? Your breath could knock a dragon out!
Player: What? No! I just had an onion. But now that you mention it, how does orc taste?
Wizard: Well, it's a bit... gamey. A real acquired taste, I assure you!

#no shower
Wizard: Good heavens! What is that smell? Did you forget to shower, or are trolls nearby?

You glance at the clock, and realize you are running very late for work!

#quickly
Thankfully your work is close enough to walk, but you know you need to run! There is some contruction down the road but

"HEY! LOOK OUT!" It was too late. You feel a sharp pain on you head as your crushed by debris.

#wake up 2
You awaken in a field of grass as a man with a staff approaches you. He is wearing a floppy hat and blue robes. He looks
like what you remember Gandalf from Lord of the Rings to look like.

Player: I don't know? One minute, I was walking to work, and the next thing I know I'm waking up here!

#story of land 1
Wizard: You are in the land of Zonia, a realm of vibrant forests, majestic mountains, dark marshes,  and ancient magic, there existed a 
prophecy whispered among the wise and old. It is foretold of the arrival of an Outsider, one who would bring a new light 
to the realm and save the land from Gorlath the giant Slime King.
Long ago, the land thrived in harmony, but darkness had begun to seep into the hearts of its inhabitants. The once-
peaceful creatures of the forest turned hostile, the skies darkened, Gorlath rose to power, and fear reigned in the 
hearts of the people. The Council of Elders, a gathering of the wisest beings in Zonia, sought answers in the ancient 
texts and discovered the prophecy. It spoke of a traveler from another world who would arrive dressed in strange
garments, wielding untapped potential and courage. This Outsider would embark on a quest to restore the fractured 
bonds of Zonia and return home.

#story of land 2
Wizard: You are the prophesied Outsider.
Player: This can't be right, I am just a simple Major Incident Manager at a big bank.
Wizard: I do not know what that is but you are the Hero.
Player: What am I supposed to do?
Wizard: Your journey starts in the quaint town of Willow Brooke, nestled between lush, green hills and crystal-clear streams. 
Known for its vibrant markets and friendly townsfolk, Willow Brooke was a hub of trade and a melting pot of cultures. 
The townspeople truly believe in the Outsider's arrival, their hearts still full of hope and anticipation.
After Willow Brooke you must travel to Valley of Whispers, a lush, fertile expanse filled with vibrant and aggressive  
flora and hidden dangers. As you venture deeper into the valley, you hear the soft rustling of leaves and the faint 
murmurs of ancient spirits. The valley is known for its enchanted winds that carry voices from the past, testing the 
resolve of travelers.

Wizard: Just follow the this road.
Player: Will you be joining me?
Wizard: I can not I have other matters to attend to, but I know you will be fine. You can find people to help you in town.
Player: I guess here goes nothing.
Wizard disappears in blast of smoke.
Player: I should be fine, just another incident to tackle.

#Enter Valley of Whispers
As you enter the Valley of Whispers, the landscape unfolds like a hidden gem, where a winding river snakes through lush terrain. 
Towering trees, with gnarled trunks and twisted branches, form a dense canopy overhead. 
The riverbanks are alive with aggressive vegetation, thick brambles, brightly colored flowers bloom defiantly amidst the thorns. 
The air is thick with humidity, carrying the rich scent of earth and green life, mixed with the occasional sharp tang of citrus from wild fruit trees. 
This is a place where nature thrives in its wildest form, a breathtaking scene of beauty and ferocity, where every element seems to be in a constant struggle for survival and dominance.
You must prepare to fight the beast in this area to make it through.

#Exit Valley of Whispers
You made it through the Valley of Whispers after some hard fought battles. On to the next chapter of your journey.

#Enter Stormspire Heights
High above the valley floor, a rugged mountain range rises dramatically, its jagged peaks piercing the sky like ancient sentinels.
The cliffs are steep and sheer, their rocky faces weathered by time and elements, displaying layers of sediment in hues of gray and ochre. 
Wisps of cloud cling to the summits, swirling in and out as if nature itself is painting a living masterpiece.
The wind howls through the crevices and across the ridges, a relentless force that tugs at loose stones and sends them tumbling into the abyss below.
Sunlight filters through the clouds, casting sharp shadows across the landscape and illuminating patches of vibrant wildflowers that stubbornly cling to life in the rocky soil.
Below, the valleys are dotted with patches of green, a stark contrast to the imposing gray cliffs above.
More beast await you in this terrifying landscape.

#Enter Dark Marsh
Finally, you arrive at the Dark Marsh, a foreboding expanse shrouded in mist and mystery. The ground is soft and 
treacherous, with hidden sinkholes and lurking shadows. The air is thick with an eerie silence, occasionally broken by 
distant croaks and rustles that send shivers down your spine.
It is here that the final challenge awaits you. Gorlath the Slime King, the malevolent entity that has been spreading 
fear throughout Zonia. To face this powerful foe, you must navigate the twisting paths of the marsh while battling 
your own fears and doubts, which manifest as shadowy creatures drawn from the darkness.

hope and the strength of your journey behind you, you can defeat Gorlath ,restore peace to Zonia, and return home.

#Lucky Find 
After your last battle you notice a small glint under a fallen log.
You lift the log to find a tiny fairy.
Fairy: Thank you, I have been trap there for sometime. I am the last of my kind tasked with waiting for the Outsider.
Player: I am sorry to hear that. I was told I am the Outsider and I am here to defeat Gorlath.
Fairy: Then these are for you.
You recieved: Excalibur
You recieved: Mithril 

#Boss fight
At the heart of the dark marsh lies an expansive clearing, a hauntingly beautiful yet foreboding sanctuary shrouded in shadow. 
Here, the air feels heavier, charged with a palpable energy that makes the skin prickle.
Bioluminescent mushrooms of various shapes and sizes spring up from the damp earth, casting an ethereal glow that bathes the clearing in hues of blues, greens, and purples.
Their soft light flickers like stars fallen from the sky, illuminating the marsh’s oppressive darkness.
Delicate wisps of glowing fog drift lazily through the air, curling and twisting as if they possess a mind of their own.
These luminous apparitions dance in the stillness, creating an otherworldly atmosphere that feels both enchanting and menacing.
The air is thick with moisture, and the faint sound of water dripping and splashing echoes softly, punctuating the eerie silence.
As you step deeper into the clearing, the ground beneath your feet shifts ominously, revealing the marsh's treacherous nature. 
Suddenly, the water in the center begins to roil and bubble violently. With a powerful surge, Gorlath, the Slime King, rises from the murky depths. 
His form is grotesque yet fascinating, a mass of undulating green and black slime that glistens in the bioluminescent glow. 
Eyes of deep amber pierce through the thick ooze, glinting with malevolence.
With a terrible roar that reverberates through the marsh, Gorlath proclaims his dominion over this shadowy realm. 
The glowing wisps swirl around him, drawn to his presence, as the marsh seems to shudder in response to his awakening. 

You have defeated Gorlath

#Ending
In the aftermath of the epic battle against the evil that had cast its shadow over the land, the world begins to breathe anew, shaking off the remnants of darkness. 
The Valley of Whispers, once shrouded in melancholic gloom, slowly transforms before your eyes. As sunlight breaks through the lingering clouds, the valley awakens with vibrant colors. 
Twisted brambles and aggressive flora give way to an explosion of life—wildflowers bloom in radiant hues, and the once-winding river sparkles with clarity, reflecting the blue sky above. 
Birds return, filling the air with joyous songs, and the gentle rustle of leaves creates a symphony of nature, replacing the valley’s former whispers of despair.
At Stormspire Heights, the dark clouds that had clung to the mountains like a heavy shroud dissipate, revealing the magnificent peaks in all their glory. 
Towering spires of granite glisten in the newfound sunlight, their surfaces catching the light and reflecting a kaleidoscope of colors.
The slopes, once barren and windswept, are now adorned with rich greenery and vibrant alpine flowers, breathing life into every crevice.
The air is fresh and invigorating, carrying the scent of pine and the promise of adventure, as if the mountains themselves are rejoicing in their liberation.
Meanwhile, the Dark Marsh undergoes its most astonishing transformation. 
As the oppressive gloom lifts, the murky waters recede, revealing lush plains dotted with blooming wildflowers and thick grasses that sway in the gentle breeze.
The once ominous pits are now glistening ponds, teeming with life.
A magnificent forest emerges at the edges of the plains, with trees that stretch high into the sky, their canopies alive with chirping birds and rustling leaves. 
At the heart of this reborn landscape lies a crystal-clear lake, its surface smooth and reflective, mirroring the vibrant blue of the sky and the surrounding greenery.
Life flourishes everywhere—deer graze peacefully by the water’s edge, and butterflies flit from flower to flower, 
while the laughter of children can be heard in the distance as they play in the newly transformed landscape.
The world, once steeped in darkness and despair, is now a harmonious blend of beauty and vitality that promises a bright future for all who inhabit it.
As you take in the breathtaking scene, a shimmering portal suddenly opens before you, swirling with colors that beckon. 
Through its luminous frame, you catch a glimpse of your path back home. With a sense of closure and hope, you step through the portal.

THE END
